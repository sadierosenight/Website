                        changes after this revision will also be charged.

                        I, the artist, claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed
                        to use the copyrighted artwork to:
                        <ul>

                                Promote myself in any way I see fit. Including but not limited to:

                    <li>
                        The buyer is allowed to:

                            <li>Use the commissioned piece for personal use, unless agreed otherwise.</li>

                <h3>7.REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The buyer is not allowed a refund once we have agreed upon the scope of the commission
                        and once I received the funds.
                    </li>
                    <li>If for any reason I am unable to complete your commission, you will receive a full refund.</li>
                    <li>
                        If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money
                        back to you myself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a
                        refund you will lose all aforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the
                        full right to profit further from it in any way. I will also decline the chargeback and give
                        Paypal our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have
                        completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If the buyer violates any of the aforementioned points, they will lose all aforementioned rights to
                    the artwork commissioned by me, the artist. I will then receive the right to profit further from the
                    commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they
                    may be changed if discussed with me prior to ordering your commissioned piece.
